# The useEffect Hook

## Intro

The `useEffect` hook in React is a way to run code after something in our component changes. It's commonly used to handle side effects, such as fetching data from a server or subscribing to events.

When we provide a dependency array to `useEffect`, React will re-run the effect whenever any of the dependencies change. By default, if we don't provide a dependency array, the effect will run after every render of the component.

However, there are scenarios where we want the effect to run only once when the component mounts and not run again for subsequent renders. To achieve this, we can pass an empty array (`[]`) as the dependency array to `useEffect`.

When we update the state of a component, React re-renders the component to show the new state. But sometimes we need to do more than just updating what's shown on the screen. We may need to fetch data from a server, update the browser's address bar, or do other things that happen outside of the normal component rendering process. These extra things are called "side effects."

The `useEffect` hook allows us to handle these side effects. We pass it a function, and React will run that function after the component has rendered and the state has changed. This way, we can keep our component's rendering and side effect logic separate.

For example, if we have a counter component and want to log a message every time the counter changes, we can use `useEffect` like this:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Count has changed:', count);
  }, [count]);

  // Rest of the component logic here
}
```

In this example, the `useEffect` hook is used to log a message to the console every time the `count` state changes. The function inside `useEffect` is executed after the component renders and the `count` state has been updated.

By using the `useEffect` hook, we can easily handle side effects in our React components, making it a powerful tool for managing additional behaviors that occur alongside state changes.
